Introduction
------------

Belenios is a verifiable voting system that partly implements the
Helios-C protocol described [here](http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/177),
which is itself derived from [Helios](http://vote.heliosvoting.org).

It consists of a command-line tool and a web server. Both use the same
backend and can be used to organize elections and perform
verifications. They employ messages formatted in a common format, a
specification of which is available in doc/specification.tex.

Compilation instructions are provided in INSTALL.md.

Election overview
-----------------

An election involves several roles: an administrator, a credential
authority, trustees and voters. For maximum security, each of these
roles must be performed by a different entity. An election can be
summarized as follows:

 1. The administrator initiates the process.
 2. The credential authority generates one credential per voter; he
    sends the private part to each voter and all public parts to
    the administrator.
 3. Each trustee generates a keypair and sends his/her public key to
    the administrator.
 4. The administrator collects all public credentials and trustees'
    public keys and sets up the election.
 5. The administrator opens the election.
 6. Each voter votes; the administrator collects, checks and publishes
    all the ballots.
 7. The administrator closes the election.
 8. Trustees collectively decrypt the result.
 9. The administrator announces the result of the election.


The command-line tool
---------------------

Each step can be performed with the help of the command-line tool. The
tool is also the most convenient way to exercise the verifiability
capabilities of the system.
